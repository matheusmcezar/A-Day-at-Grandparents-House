Ok, we three (you who's playing, me the character and the creator) know that it's a SUPER simple scene. But please, understand. It's our first time together.
Matt, the boring guy that created this game (can we call it that way?) is still learning.
He has been a software developer for more than 10 years, but develping games is something new.
